                p.text All requests to Binance could pass only from one IP address ‚Äî via HERE proxy server. Requests can‚Äôt be changed as they are signed with a secret API key which is stored locally on the phone.
                p.text However, as the requests can come only from one IP address, we can skip a request if it looks suspicious to us. Our proxy server monitors daily limits and does not let suspicious transactions through.
