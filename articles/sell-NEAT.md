The first step is to go to the website: https://near.org/inscribe.near/widget/NEAT?tab=wrap and connect your [HERE wallet](https://download.herewallet.app/site). Here, you can wrap NEAT into wNEAT to sell them.

We suggest entering the amount of NEAT manually because after clicking 'select max,' the 'wrap' button isn't clickable.

After successfully wrapping, go to your HERE wallet, and you'll see wNEAT in your balance. To swap, click 'swap' and choose wNEAT â€“ near (we recommend pairing it with NEAR or USDCe for better liquidity).
Congratulations on your profit!
