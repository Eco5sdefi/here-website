We've gathered the most exciting updates from the month of September to give you a sneak peek into what our team has been working on and what we've accomplished.

## 1. Completed our campaign on Gitcoin

[Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) is the largest web3 platform for donating to startups. Every quarter, they carefully select projects that qualify for their campaign. We're thrilled to share that HERE wallet made it into the top 25 projects in terms of donations, raising an impressive $3,000.

##  2. Launched Weekly Score

We introduced an exciting feature called "Weekly Score" within the HERE wallet. Users can now complete various missions and earn score points. These tasks range from staking and swaps to creating content. At the end of each week, the top users receive USDT as rewards. With each passing week, the rewards keep getting better. In the third week alone, 5,365 users participated.

## 3. Integration with Orderly Network

We're excited to announce our partnership with Orderly Network. As part of this collaboration, we've integrated swaps through Orderly Network directly into the HERE wallet. This means users can now swap their assets at the best rates without leaving the HERE wallet. Additionally, users can track their stats in the Orderly manager, including the number of exchanges and turnover.

## 4. Aurora available in Beta

We have some big news on the horizon! HERE wallet will soon be adding the Aurora network. This week, we'll be granting beta test access to users with high scores, and holders of HERE early user NFTs can start testing already. This partnership opens up exciting new possibilities for us.

## 6.Ref swaps moved on low-level computations 

For our Android users, we've rewritten our swap functionality in Kotlin, a native language for Android applications. This enhancement will significantly improve the speed at which you can find swap routes.

In September, we've made significant strides to enhance your experience with HERE wallet, and we're excited to continue innovating and bringing you more exciting features in the months to come. Thank you for being part of our journey!
