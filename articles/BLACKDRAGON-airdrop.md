## How to View and Exchange Tokens

Access the **HERE wallet** (If not installed, [download](https://download.herewallet.app/blog) the app on your phone, then import your account)

Upon receiving NFTs and tokens, you can trade them directly through the HERE wallet. (*HERE imposes no exchange fees and provides the best DEX rates on NEAR*)

It's recommended to trade for NEAR or USDC.e as they offer higher liquidity.
