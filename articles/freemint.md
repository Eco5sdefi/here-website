In celebration of the largest conference in Asia, NEAR APAC, we have prepared a collection of 10,000 Starboxes.

A Starbox is an NFT on the NEAR Protocol network, but with a twist. After the drop ends, you can open the box (burn the NFT) and discover a hidden gift inside, ranging from $0 to $150. If you don't manage to open it within the specified time, the NFT will remain as a memory and become part of the HERE collection.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è What you can find inside the NFT:

1. **1000 USDT** divided among 500 boxes, ranging from 1 to 10 USDT.
2. **5 HERE NFTs** (floor 30 NEAR) - unlocking many features in your wallet, providing +1% APY on liquid staking, and accelerating your SCORE accumulation.
3. **+150 SCORE** in 2000 boxes. A high SCORE grants access to new features, enables earning cashback for swaps and gas refunds. Additionally, the top 10 users with the highest SCORE growth receive USDT weekly (read more about SCORE).
4. **1 Mutation Potion.** A total of 99 mutation potions are issued, which can transform your HERE NFT. Mutation floor is **99 NEAR**!

In total, there are over 2500 starboxes with prizes, so your chances of winning are quite high. You can mint a total of 3 NFTs for free.

## üéâ Who can mint the NFTs?

**1Ô∏è‚É£ 1st NFT.** Everyone with a unique device, just connect your HERE Wallet and mint in time. We recommend setting an alarm and reminder for the start of the drop.
