In celebration of the largest conference in Asia, **NEAR APAC**, we have prepared a collection of 10,000 Starboxes.

A Starbox is an NFT on the NEAR Protocol network, but with a twist. After the drop ends, you can open the box (burn the NFT) and discover a hidden gift inside, ranging from $1 to $150. If you don't manage to open it within the specified time, the NFT will remain as a memory and become part of the HERE collection.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è What you can find inside the NFT:

1. **1000 USDT** divided among 552 boxes, ranging from 1 to 100 USDT.
   - 2x $100
   - 10x $10
   - 40x $5
   - 500x $1
2. **10 HERE NFTs** (floor 30 NEAR) - unlocking many features in your wallet, providing +1% APY on liquid staking, and accelerating your SCORE accumulation.
3. **+150 SCORE** in 5000 boxes. A high SCORE grants access to new features, enables earning cashback for swaps and gas refunds. Additionally, the top 10 users with the highest SCORE growth receive USDT weekly ([read more](https://www.herewallet.app/blog/here-score-29ce3537e225) about SCORE).
4. **1 Mutation Potion.** A total of 99 mutation potions are issued, which can transform your HERE NFT. Mutation floor is **99 NEAR**!

In total, there are over 5500 starboxes with prizes, so your chances of winning are high. You can mint a total of 3 NFTs for free.

## üéâ Who can mint the NFTs?

**1st NFT.** Everyone with a unique device, just connect your HERE Wallet and mint in time. We recommend setting an alarm and reminder for the start of the drop.

**2d NFT.** Everyone who has 150+ Score. You can easily get score by making a few swaps or inviting a friend. [Read more](https://www.herewallet.app/blog/here-score-29ce3537e225). **Check in Open App -> Profile tab -> My Score**

**3d NFT.** Verified Users. To verify your account connect your Binance account. **Open App -> Settings -> Accounts connected -> +Binance**

## ‚òëÔ∏è Which wallet is suitable?

You need to mint NFTs on the NEAR Protocol, and for that, you need a special wallet - HERE Wallet. It's the best mobile wallet that allows you to use any applications on NEAR. What makes it the best wallet:

- Built-in liquid staking without fees for instant withdrawal
- Numerous bonuses and rewards in USDT for high score and social activities
- Ability to connect a Binance account and make transactions directly from the exchange balance

üëç You can download it for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herewallet&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/here-wallet-for-near-protocol/id1634994703).
