To successfully generate a new seed phrase, it's crucial to have only one key on your wallet. Follow these steps:
1. Open settings -> Key Manager.
2. Ensure that you have only one key. If not, remove any extras.

## Step 2: Import to Web Version

Go to [this link](https://my.herewallet.app/settings/passphrase?change-seed) to initiate the seed phrase change process and click *generate new seed phrase*. Make sure to note and save the new seed phrase.

After successful generation, log in again to the mobile app and Telegram wallet using the **new seed phrase**. Remember, never disclose your seed phrase and avoid importing it into untrusted wallets.

We plan to reintroduce this feature to the mobile app soon. Thank you for your understanding!
