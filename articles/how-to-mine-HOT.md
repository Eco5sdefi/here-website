## HOT

HOT is like a special token for the NEAR ecosystem inside Telegram. Because of meta-transactions, using HOT lets you do real transactions on the blockchain, play games, and pay for transfers. It is the first FT that has the functionality of native L1 blockchain tokens.

In the future, HOT won't just work with NEAR Ecosystem. After something called Chain Abstraction starts in Q2 2024, you'll be able to use $HOT to do transactions on Ethereum and other networks that are like Ethereum.

### How to start mining HOT

The mining process starts as soon as you create a wallet and get your first free HOT when you click "Claim" (link to article).

After you have received your first HOT the mining process starts, but it will stop when the Storage bar fills up.

## Storage

First you have a very small fire and every 2 hours you need to make sure it doesn't go out. For this purpose, there is a Storage indicator. Once this indicator is full, HOT will stop mining until you claim them.



Initially Storage is only enough for 2 hours of mining, but you can pump it up by using HOTs to increase the time of uninterrupted mining.

There are a total of 6 levels of Storage:

Level 0 -  Wooden Storage - 2 hours - free

Level 1 - Metal Storage - 3 hours - 0.2 HOT

Level 2 - Modular Storage - 4 hours - 0.5 HOT

Level 3 - Liquid Storage - 6 hours - 1 HOT

Level 4 - Titanium Storage - 12 hours - 4 HOT

Level 5 - Gold Storage - 24 hours - 10 HOT

## Mining Speed

The more HOT you have, the better!  So the most important thing is the speed of mining. There are 3 ways to increase it:

### Fireplace

The Fireplace is responsible for the basic speed of mining HOT, and you can level it up just like Storage using HOT.

There are 5 levels of Fireplace in total

Level 0 -  Wood Firespace - 0.01 HOT/hour - free 

Level 1 -  Stone Firespace - 0.015 HOT/hour - 0.2 HOT

Level 2 -  Gas Firespace - 0.02 HOT/hour - 1 HOT

Level 3 -  Neon Firespace - 0.025 HOT/hour - 2 HOT

Level 4 -  Neon Multi-Firespace - 0.03 HOT/hour - 5 HOT

Level 5 -  Gold Fireplace - 0.05 HOT/hour - 15 HOT

### Wood

Woods are used to significantly boost HOT mining, specifically designed for the most active users who are ready to dive deep into the NEAR Protocol ecosystem with us. To get the multiplier, you need to complete various missions.

### Referral system

The most effective way to mine HOT is by inviting friends. We've set up a two-level referral system. You get an extra 20% after each claim made by your direct referral and 5% after each claim made by those invited by your referral.

To invite a friend, click on "Friends" and send the link to your friend.

## Claim HOT

![How to claim HOT](https://storage.herewallet.app/upload/0ed39d13-03ea-4c22-bd03-0165113ba69c.png)

HOT is indeed recorded on the blockchain (on-chain) once you claim it. For each HOT claim, you need to pay a network fee, also known as gas. However, since we use the NEAR Protocol, network fees are very low (around $0.005) and are deducted for each transaction in the $NEAR token.

Initially, you have 3 free transactions (we cover the gas for you). However, afterward, to claim HOT, you have 3 options:

**1. Top Up NEAR**

Simply add NEAR to your address; find out how to do it here.

**2. Pay Fees with HOT**

We caution that you can do this, but it's more cost-effective to use NEAR for covering network fees.

**3. Complete Missions**

Complete special missions and earn free transactions.
