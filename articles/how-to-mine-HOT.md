## HOT

HOT is a central [piece for the NEAR ecosystem inside Telegram](https://t.me/herewalletbot). Because of meta-transactions, using HOT lets you do real transactions on the blockchain, play games, and pay for transfers. It is the first FT that has the functionality of native L1 blockchain tokens.

Every Claim you make, every friend, every village, and so forth â€“ it's all built on the NEAR Protocol blockchain. NEAR stands out for its high scalability, low transaction costs, and high speed.

HOT holds the top spot for the number of unique wallets among all applications on all blockchains according to [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/rankings) data. At the time of writing this article, approximately 800k wallets interact with HOT every day.

In the future, HOT will not be exclusively tied to the NEAR ecosystem. After the launch of the HOT Protocol in the second quarter of 2024, you will be able to use HOT to conduct transactions on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks.

## How to view blockchain data

The blockchain helps to create a truly fair and transparent distribution system, where every transaction or action can be traced.

To view the data, you can use [nearblocks.io](https://nearblocks.io) or [pikespeak.ai](https://pikespeak.ai/), entering your wallet address into the search bar.

## How to start mining HOT

The mining process starts as soon as you create a wallet and get your first free HOT when you click "Claim".

After receiving the initial HOT, the mining process begins, but it stops once your Storage is filled.

## Storage

At the beginning, there's a small-capacity Storage, and it's important to ensure it's not completely filled. There's a storage indicator for this purpose. Once this indicator is full, mining will stop until HOT is claimed.

Initially Storage is only enough for 2 hours of mining, but you can pump it up by using HOTs to increase the time of uninterrupted mining.

There are 6 levels of Storage in total:

- Level 1 -  Wooden Storage - 2 hours - free;
- Level 2 - Metal Storage - 3 hours - 0.2 HOT;
- Level 3 - Modular Storage - 4 hours - 0.5 HOT;
- Level 4 - Liquid Storage - 6 hours - 1 HOT;
- Level 5 - Titanium Storage - 12 hours - 4 HOT;
- Level 6 - Gold Storage - 24 hours - 10 HOT.

## Mining Speed

The more HOT you have, the better! So the most important thing is the speed of mining. There are 3 ways to increase it:

### Fireplace

The Fireplace is responsible for the basic speed of mining HOT, and you can level it up just like Storage using HOT.

There are 6 levels of Fireplace in total:

- Level 1 -  Wood Fireplace - 0.005 HOT/hour - free;
- Level 2 -  Stone Fireplace - 0.0075 HOT/hour - 0.2 HOT;
- Level 3 -  Gas Fireplace - 0.01 HOT/hour - 1 HOT;
- Level 4 -  Neon Fireplace - 0.0125 HOT/hour - 2 HOT;
- Level 5 -  Neon Multi-Fireplace - 0.015 HOT/hour - 5 HOT;
- Level 6 -  Gold Fireplace - 0.025 HOT/hour - 15 HOT

### Wood

Woods are used to significantly increase HOT mining output, offering special missions for active users willing to immerse themselves in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem with us.

Each completed mission grants a new level of Wood and a multiplier to HOT mining:

- Level 1 - Basic Wood - 1.0x HOT/hour;
- Level 2 - Neon Wood - 1.2x HOT/hour - Install HERE Wallet app;
- Level 3 - Titanium Wood - 1.5x HOT/hour - Top up balance with 0.5 NEAR;
- Level 4 - Jedi Wood - 1.8x HOT/hour - Top up balance with 1+ USDT;
- Level 5 - Uranium Boxes - 2x HOT/hour - Invite a referral.

### Referral system

The most effective way to mine HOT is by inviting friends. We've set up a two-level referral system. You get an extra 20% after each claim made by your direct referral and 5% after each claim made by those invited by your referral.

To invite a friend, click on "Friends" and send the link to your friend.

## Claim HOT

![How to claim HOT](https://storage.herewallet.app/upload/8fc25350365040aaf4bb78642b17f98c687705cc4e8a61ef7519d3a6c8544de6.png)
HOT is indeed recorded on the blockchain (on-chain) once you claim it. For each HOT claim, you need to pay a network fee, also known as gas. However, since we use the NEAR Protocol, network fees are very low (around $0.005) and are deducted for each transaction in the $NEAR token.

Initially, you have 3 free transactions (we cover the gas for you). However, afterward, to claim HOT, you have 3 options:

- top up the balance with NEAR tokens to cover future fees;
- pay a 30% commission in HOT for gas fees on our side;
- complete special missions and earn free transactions.
