Since Binance added [support for USDC on the NEAR Protocol](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-usd-coin-usdc-on-near-protocol-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-1ade588ceb9845b78ec785f123b986fd), NEAR users have had a question about which stablecoin to store their funds in. In this article, we will try to explain the differences between them.

## What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are tokens linked to assets like the dollar, euro, or gold. In the Web3 world, when people talk about "stablecoins," they usually mean tokens tied to the US dollar. The most popular ones are USDT and USDC.

## Differences

The fundamental difference is that [Tether](https://tether.to/) and [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/), two different companies, create these coins (that's why you see 'T' or 'C' in the token names). This makes people wonder about how secure they are and how these companies make sure their stablecoins stay steady.

## USDT

The backing of USDT can be monitored on their [website](https://tether.to/ru/transparency/#reports). As of the time of writing this article, the backing looks as follows:

As of the time of writing, USDT on the NEAR Protocol is available on exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Gate, and Bitfinex.

## USDĞ¡

Historically, USDC has had better transparency, and you can check the backing [here](https://www.circle.com/en/transparency).

As of the time of writing, USDC on the NEAR Protocol is available on Binance.

## Conclusion

Historically, USDC is considered more transparent and secure, but USDT has a longer history. Both tokens are great for storage and transfers, but typically, for exchanges and user transfers, USDT is more popular, while in the DeFi space, USDC confidently takes the lead.
