HERE wallet has added support for the first EMV network - Aurora. In this guide, you will learn how to add the Aurora network and transfer tokens from the NEAR to the Aurora.

### Adding Aurora to HERE Wallet

First, you need to add Aurora network to your HERE wallet. You can either import an existing Aurora address using your seed phrase or private key or create a new one using the seed phrase from your NEAR address. This way, you'll have a unified seed phrase for both networks

### Transferring Tokens via Rainbow Bridge

Token transfers are done through the [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer). The Rainbow Bridge is the official bridge for transferring tokens between the Ethereum, NEAR and Aurora blockchains. 

To make the transfer, you need to connect your HERE wallet to the [https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer) website in the NEAR network.

Then, you also need to connect your HERE wallet in the Aurora network.
