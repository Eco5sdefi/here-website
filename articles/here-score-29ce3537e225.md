In the HERE update 1.3.0 the score of the account appeared. In this article, we’ll explain in detail what it is, how to get it, and why you need it

Score is a rating of activity in the app. It is attached to an account and cannot be sent to friends or bought for money. It consists of a permanent and a variable part. Permanent is accumulated for the use of certain features / contests / inviting friends and can only increase. Dynamic part depends on the balance or amount of money in steaking and can change.

## What gives a high score?

1. **Private features**. New features are unlocked in the app after reaching the score threshold. You can earn USDT and get gifts for the found bugs

2. **+APY**. The more score, the more profit you get from staking. Up to 10.2% per annum!

3. **Cashback**. Users with score higher than 2500 can do gas free transactions between friends, get cashback for swaps, and purchase of some NFTs

**Levels:**

**0–100** — I am not a bot 🤖 
**500–1500** — Start earn more APY, +0.1% for each 100 score 💸 
**400, 800, 1200 **— Unlocking a secret feature 🔐 
**2500** — God mode. Gas free transactions / cashback for swaps ☁️
